# yaml-sigil-verification

`yaml-sigil-verification` verifies
[`yaml-sigil`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/yaml-sigil-spec#tldr) documents and
their signatures in YAML and protobuf forms.

Use this crate to check document structure, verify Ed25519 or ECDSA P-256
SHA-256 signatures, and retrieve payload bytes only after successful
verification. The public results classify each attempt into the `yaml-sigil`
verifier states.

## API Surface

- `verify`, `verify_yaml`, and `verify_proto` run verification.
- Their `_with_resource_limits` variants apply an explicit complete-input
  policy before verification work.
- `pre_verify`, `pre_verify_yaml`, and `pre_verify_proto` run structural checks
  without crypto.
- Their `_with_resource_limits` variants and
  `can_pre_verify_with_resource_limits` check the original encoded input.
- `verify_from_pre_verify` and its form-specific helpers reuse successful
  pre-verification results.
- `VerificationProviderBuilder` either qualifies one exact synchronous
  provider instance or constructs an explicitly unqualified provider.
- `verify_with_provider` and its metadata and pre-verification
  variants retain YamlSigil artifact handling around qualified provider keys.
- The corresponding `verify_with_unqualified_provider` functions make the
  qualification bypass explicit.
- `DefaultVerifier` and `DefaultAsyncVerifier` delegate to the free functions.
- `Verifier`, `AsyncVerifier`, result types, and capability types are
  re-exported from
  [`yaml-sigil-traits`](https://crates.io/crates/yaml-sigil-traits).
- `PublicKeys` accepts verifying keys from
  [`ed25519-dalek`](https://crates.io/crates/ed25519-dalek) and
  [`p256`](https://crates.io/crates/p256).
- `resolve_ed25519_verifying_key` and `resolve_p256_verifying_key` turn raw
  public-key bytes into those key types.

`PublicKeys` contains caller-supplied verification keys indexed by algorithm.
The artifact's unsigned `keyid` remains a deployment-specific lookup hint.
The shared traits leave key parsing to each implementation. This crate applies
its Ed25519 key-admissibility checks both when it resolves raw key bytes and
when a caller supplies an already constructed typed key.

`resolve_p256_verifying_key` accepts only the 65-byte uncompressed
`0x04 || X || Y` encoding from
*Standards for Efficient Cryptography 1 (SEC 1)*.

Bind each artifact source, route, or storage class to one `ArtifactForm` before
calling the verifier. Do not infer the form from artifact bytes or retry the
other form after structural or verification failure.

Only payload bytes returned by `VerifierState::Verified` are authenticated. A
signature document inside those bytes remains payload content.

## Local provider verification

Add a direct dependency on
[`signature`](https://crates.io/crates/signature) 2.2. Implement
`signature::Verifier<[u8; 64]>` and `ProviderVerifier` for your bound provider
handle, then implement `ProviderVerifierFactory` for the type that creates
those handles. All three traits are public extension contracts. Keep each
handle bound to its own key even when the factory binds another key.

Follow the
[compiling adapter example](https://docs.rs/yaml-sigil-verification/latest/yaml_sigil_verification/provider/index.html#implement-a-verification-adapter)
through trait implementation, qualification, key binding, and
`verify_with_provider`. The provider traits and key types are re-exported at
the crate root and available in its public `provider` module. Bound keys are
opaque inputs to these artifact operations. Implementing the separate
`yaml_sigil_traits::verification::Verifier` contract means supplying the
complete operation, including artifact processing.

Implement `ProviderVerifierFactory` to bind canonical public-key bytes to an
opaque local provider handle. Ed25519 keys use 32 canonical compressed octets.
P-256 keys use the 65-octet uncompressed encoding from
*Standards for Efficient Cryptography 1 (SEC 1)*. YamlSigil validates the key
before asking the factory to bind it and rejects malformed 64-octet
signatures before provider verification.

Bound `ProviderVerifier` handles must implement `Send + Sync`. Both qualified
and unqualified bound keys preserve those guarantees, so you can move or share
them across worker threads. Adapters with mutable state synchronize it
internally.

`VerificationProviderBuilder::qualify` runs a bounded, public-only fixed suite
once for the exact adapter instance it consumes. It records independent
Ed25519 and P-256 status. A rejected slot cannot create a qualified key, but it
does not disable another slot. Replacing or reconfiguring the adapter requires
qualification again. Finite qualification shows that the instance passes the
included suite; it is not proof for every possible input or future
configuration.

The P-256 suite keeps two distinct key bindings live and interleaves valid
signatures with cross-key rejection checks. It rejects adapters that cache
the first key or retarget existing handles when another key is bound.

Qualified results are authoritative. YamlSigil does not retry a provider
mismatch through RustCrypto. Implementations that can distinguish an
operational failure from a signature mismatch override
`ProviderVerifier::verify_provider`; YamlSigil keeps those outcomes separate.
`build_unqualified` and the explicitly named unqualified operations skip the
fixed suite while retaining YamlSigil's key and signature-structure checks.

The provider receives the exact extracted payload and a raw 64-octet
signature. P-256 adapters verify SHA-256 over those message bytes and accept
big-endian `r || s`, not DER. The development matrix exercises RustCrypto,
`ring`, and `aws-lc-rs` adapters. Provider support or qualification does not
establish or imply FIPS validation.

To bound provider verification, admit the original artifact with
`ArtifactResourceLimits::check_input_size` before calling a provider operation.
A bounded pre-verification response can also be passed to
`verify_from_pre_verify_with_provider`.

## Resource boundaries

Resource-aware verification, pre-verification, and the boolean summary check
the original complete input before form options, parsing, copying, or
cryptography. Their outer `ArtifactResourceResult` reports resource admission;
the inner result or verifier state preserves the existing contract.

Bounded pre-verification enforces complete-input size once while the original
encoded artifact is available. Continue with the existing
`verify_from_pre_verify` functions. They receive in-memory components and do
not reconstruct or recheck an encoded artifact.

YamlSigil `v1alpha1` defines no maximum complete artifact size. A local
resource-policy rejection remains separate from invocation errors, malformed
artifacts, failed cryptographic verification, and conformance results. A
deployment can choose a lower limit, a higher limit, or no additional limit;
`DEFAULT_MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES` defines the explicit default. Existing
verification entry points and default trait implementations remain unbounded
by this policy. Adopt a bounded operation at the affected trust boundary or
enforce an equivalent earlier raw-input bound. Protobuf format limits, parser
safeguards, address-space limits, allocator limits, and deployment controls
still apply.

## YAML Signature-Document Behavior

The verifier advertises `AdvertisedConformanceProfile::Permissive`. Its YAML
decoder rejects duplicate known mapping keys under every profile and returns
`MalformedAttemptedSigned`; it does not select an effective value from
duplicate occurrences. The decoder also rejects unknown top-level fields,
which is stricter than the `Permissive` requirement.

Before parsing an unauthenticated YAML signature carrier, the verifier applies
these implementation-specific hard bounds:

| Parser dimension | Bound |
|------------------|------:|
| Markerless carrier bytes | 16,384 |
| Nesting depth | 16 |
| Alias expansions | 0 |
| Mapping keys | 8 |
| Sequence length | 16 |
| Parser events | 128 |
| Constructed nodes | 64 |
| Cumulative scalar bytes | 8,192 |
| Documents | 1 |
| Merge keys | 8 |

The parser rejects anchors, aliases, custom tags, and duplicate keys. These
values describe this Rust implementation; they are not portable `yaml-sigil`
limits except for the 16,384-octet markerless carrier limit. That carrier
constraint is independent of complete artifact size.

The verifier exposes parser observations when callers request them. It does not
provide RPC transport.
